# kicad-libraries

This is my personal collection of KiCAD footprints and symbols. By and large,
they have been designed by me. If they haven't, I will attribute them below,
and include the licenses in a way that seems reasonable.

# Attributions

## SOICbite

As of including, this has no license, but I do have permission from the author.
